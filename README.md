The final version of my visual argument is titled "Beyond the Glass Ceiling." Because my argument is relatively difficult to communicate visually, I found that I had to rely on well-known words and phrases like "a seat at the table" and "glass ceiling" to inform the audience of my piece's meaning. The "glass ceiling" is a metaphor for the barriers that prevent people from hostorically marginalized and oppressed demographics from rising up the ranks of a given social hierarchy. We often here the phrase "shattering the glass ceiling" in response to someone who rises up in the hierarchy despite the obstacles that face them due to a certain quality they possess (gender, race, disability, sexual orientation, etc.). Thus, my image presents what happens next, i.e., the world "beyond the glass ceiling," and reveals it to be corrupt.

I think it really helps the viewer understand my argument if the title is included with the image. I even thought about adding it was text, but I felt that may be overkill, as well as make the composition too cluttered. My visual argument encourages the viewer to be skeptical of positions of power, regardless of who is in that position. Essentially, I am arguing that people from marginilized groups- in this case, women- assuming positions of power that were previously reserved for white, straight men, is not true equality. 

Above all, I hope "Beyond the Glass Ceiling" prompts the viewer to think critically about the ideas it raises. Enjoy!
