In my visual argument proposal, I wanted to create an argument about feeling helpless against the world in the modern day. However, 
since our last class, and after looking around at different images, I have decided to change my project. Instead, I want to create anargument that critiques
modern day feminism's tendency to push women to be in the same roles and institutions as men, even if those institutions are harmful. The phrase "a seat 
at the table" is something we often hear in regards to people from margianalized groups assuming roles that have been historically reserved for white men.
I want to explore and critique why we are more inclined to push people from these groups- in my case, women, to achieve these roles and earn a "seat at the 
table" than question whether this table should exist in the first place.
My preview is far from finished as I recently changed my plans, and have also been having trouble with GIMP and might look into photoshop, but I have my idea
pretty much figured out. The image of the men sitting at the table, which is a Josef Herman's 1987 painting "Men at Table, is in the upper right corner, surrounded by a white 
border (I am going to change the border, it's just there now as a placeholder). The text says: "Welcome, we've saved you a seat," in a rather cryptic font.
In the bottom left corner, I am going to add an image of a woman whose back is facing us, implying that she is looking at the table. I couldn't find
a good image of this, so I think I will photograph one of my friends. On the table, I am going to add photorealistic plates and silverware, and on the plates
I am going to add images that represent what the men are consuming and the harm these men are causing. For example, I might put stacks of money on the plates
(although that feels a bit too Political Cartoon-y), or images that symbolize climate change, poverty, etc. I am also going to add nametags to the men, and may even try 
to subtly add logos of different corporations like Amazon, Tesla, banks, etc., but I want to make sure the brands aren't too obvious. The final version will 
likely be very cluttered and busy, with little negative space, giving the eyes lots to look at. I want to invoke feelings of chaos and disorganization,
somewhat remeniscint of the Post-Daddaism art style. I'm pretty much set on what I'm doing, I just have to figure out how to execute it.
